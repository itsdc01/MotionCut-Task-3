                153-point AF system with 99 cross sensors provides powerful subject acquisition in diverse situations
                Approx. 9-fps high-speed captures 45-megapixel images with the optional MB-D18 Multi-Power Battery Pack*1 attached, or at 7 fps with the body only

                Optical viewfinder with 0.75x magnification*3 providing a wide field of view for easier subject confirmation, while keeping a sufficiently long eye point
